/*
E. Maximum Median

Given an array, you can change the elements of the array by increasing an
individual element by 1. I.e. arr[i] = (arr[i]+1). Given k of these operations,
return the largest possible median.

Example:
1 2 3 4 5 -> median = 3
k = 1;
1 2 3 4 5 -> 1 2 4 4 5 -> median =  4

Input:
n (num of elements) k (num of operations)
arr of size n

Output:
Max median
